## About the Project

This project aims to predict diabetes progression using machine learning regression models. It utilizes the diabetes dataset from the Scikit-learn library and explores various regression algorithms to predict the progression of diabetes based on different features.

Key features of the project include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify important features.
- Selection of relevant features for modeling.
- Training and evaluation of multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
- Selection of the best performing model for diabetes progression prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/J3lly-Been/diabetes-progression-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
